# Convergence of K-means

As described in the algorithm, the cost function $J$ is:
$$J(C_1, C_2,...,C_k, c_1, c_2,...,c_k) = \sum_{j=1}^{k}\sum_{i\in C_k}||x_i - c_k||$$


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
